## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

The [original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravishah1/carvana-predict-car-prices) contained various inconsistencies. Below are the key cleaning steps I applied:

- Removed rows with empty or null values.
- Converted text columns into categorical variables.
- Converted price and mileage columns into numerical types.
- Created new columns to extract information such as brand and model.
- Exported the cleaned dataset and uploaded it to Tableau Public for visualization.

Due to the type and volume of the data, all cleaning was done using **Google Sheets**. See the cleaned file at [cleaned data](Projects/Carvana_price_Analysis/Carvana_Data_Clean.csv).

## üîë Key Insights

### **1. Inverse relationship between Price and Mileage**

There is a clear and consistent negative trend between price and mileage: the higher the mileage, the lower the vehicle‚Äôs price. This pattern is visible in the scatter plot.

### **2. Tesla and Lexus maintain high prices despite high mileage**

Unlike other brands, Tesla and Lexus tend to retain high prices even when their vehicles have significant mileage. This could be due to their perception as premium or luxury brands.

### **3. Price distribution varies significantly by brand**

Brands like **BMW** and **Mercedes-Benz** show a wide price distribution, likely due to the variety of models they offer across different segments.
