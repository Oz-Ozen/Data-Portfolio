## About Me 

I'm a data analyst with a background in nanotechnology engineering, passionate about using data to understand complex systems and drive better decisions.  
My focus is on Python, machine learning, and data visualization, and I'm currently building projects that reflect real-world challenges and business use cases. I enjoy translating raw data into meaningful insights and am actively preparing for a professional career in data analysis and data science.

I'm constantly learning new tools and techniques to improve my workflow and understanding. My goal is to join a data-driven team where I can grow, contribute, and keep learning.
